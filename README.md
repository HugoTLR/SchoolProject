python main.py [-v testvid.xxx] [-a min_area] [-f True]

if -f True, the program will save in db a sign for each box detected on stream.

TODO LIST:
  -Create a pattern sign from command line instead of searching from DB
  -Optimize signature detection
  -Optimize light detection (use average light of the scene ? maybe too much calculation )
